Questions:
- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- are such differences between species and conservation status important?
- What animal is the most prevalent in distribution among parks?

## DATA:
- proprietary 'observations.csv' and 'species_info.csv' data from Codecademy.
- observations data has info of species with park locations.
- species_info data contains characteristics of each species.
